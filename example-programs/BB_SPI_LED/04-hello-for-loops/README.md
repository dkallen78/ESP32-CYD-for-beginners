# Hello For Loops

So now you know what for loops are, let's play with them a bit more to see what kinds of things we can do with them.

That wipe erase was pretty cool, let's do it again, but from the other side! To pull this off, all we need to do is change up some of the details of our for loop. Let's start by thinking about what the for loop in the current [hello-world-wipe-blink.ino](../03-hello-loops/hello-world-wipe-blink.ino) file is doing.

It's drawing 140 (the length of the area we need to clear) 1 pixel by 24 pixel rectangles starting from the left edge of the rectangle (the randomly generated <var>`x`</var> value) to the right edge of the rectangle. Our job now is to do the same thing but from the right edge (<var>`x`</var> + 140) to the left edge (<var>`x`</var> + 0). Let's figure out what we need to put in our for loop logic.

```c++
for (int i = ?; i <?> ?; ?)
```

Since we're essentially working backwards from our previous for loop, we can probably just swap some of the values. For example, whereas our previous for loop ends at 140, our current for loop needs to start at 140.

```c++
for (int i = 140; i <?> ?; ?)
```

Again, our previous loop started at 0, this one needs to end at 0; in other words, our for loop should run as long as i â‰¥0.

```c++
for (int i = 140; i >= 0; ?)
```

Finally, instead of counting up from 0, our loop is counting down from 140, so we need to decrement by 1 each loop.

```c++
for (int i = 140; i >= 0; i--)
```

We should be able to drop this in to our previous code.

```c++
for (int i = 140; i >= 0; i--) {
  delay(2);
  lcd.fillRect(x + i, y, 1, 24, TFT_BLUE);
}
```

Neat. 

Let's go just one step further. How about we wipe it from both ends at the same time? You might think that you would need two for loops to achieve this, and you could indeed accomplish this with nested for loops,

```c++
for (int i = 0; i <= 70; i++) {
  for (int j = 140; j > 70; j-- {
    ...
  })
}
```

but there's a simpler way to do this. For loops can initialize and iterate two variables. We already know the numbers we're working with, so let's plug everything in.

Let's use <var>`i`</var> to draw our skinny rectangles from left to center and <var>`j`</var> to draw them from right to center. That means <var>`i`</var> will start at 0 and <var>`j`</var> will start at 140. We also know that <var>`i`</var> needs to count up, while <var>`j`</var> needs to count down. All that leaves is our condition. As long as our <var>`i`</var> value is no more than than half the length of our rectangle (140 / 2 = 70), the for loop should continue. Let's plug that into our new for loop.

```c++
for (int i = 0, j = 140; i <= 70; i++, j--)
```

We also have to draw two skinny rectangles per loop, one on each side of the area we're drawing over.

```c++
lcd.fillRect(x + i, y, 1, 24, TFT_BLUE);
lcd.fillRect(x + j, y, 1, 24, TFT_BLUE);
```
