# Hello World

Every great programming journey starts with a "hello world" program, and why should the CYD be any different? 

To get started, take a look at the [hello-world-bb_spi_lcd-1.ino](hello-world-bb_spi_lcd-1.ino) file (ugly name, I know, but it will make sense later). If you've worked with the Arduino IDE or microcontrollers before, this will probably look familiar. If not, don't worry, I'll explain all the important parts. To keep things simple for now, just copy and paste everything from `#INCLUDE` down to the last `}` into the Arduino IDE and upload it into your CYD.

It's not pretty, but it works!

Let's take a closer look at the code to see what's going on.
