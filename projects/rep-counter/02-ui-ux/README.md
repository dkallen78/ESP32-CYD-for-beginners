# User Interface and User eXperience

UI and UX are really big umbrellas for a lot of small details that coalesce into the vibe of your program. This is the kind of thing I always have in the back of my mind, but until I pull it out into the light, I usually don't realize how amorphous my ideas are. But, now that I've demonstrated the feasability of my idea by making a working prototype, it's a good time to put a little polish on my UI/UX. Plus, making it nice to look at will keep me motivated to continue adding features.

Before I tinker with the UI anymore, I want to figure out the scope of my program. I know that at its core, it's a rep counter, but that leaves a lot of things left unsaid. For instance, what am I counting reps of? *I'm* planning on counting pull-ups and push-ups, but there's a lot of joy to be had in making something for other people, even if noone ever uses it. What I'm getting at is, what if people want to use the program, but they don't want to track pull-ups? Should I expect any other users of this program to edit my source code or save files to make it work for them? Lots of developers take that approach but I'd rather make something more user-friendly. As such, I'm going to need a way for users to add their own exercises which means text input.
