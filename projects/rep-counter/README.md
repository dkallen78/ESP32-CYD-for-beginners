# Building a Rep Counter

I've been trying to up my pull-ups lately and I want an easy way to keep track of how many I do throughout the day and a reminder to get out of my chair and crank some out. I also want to be able to see my data as a web page. There may be some stuff I add on later, but for now, this is the core of the program. 

## Requirements

1. C++
2. Arduino
3. JavaScript/HTML/CSS
